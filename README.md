Flappy Bird with a RegularShow theme and controlled by the movement of the hand

The two folders should run independently. First the python script and after that the game.
The script recognize the hand and map the movement of the palm and move the cursor and by closing the fist you can click. This is how you can control the bird, by closing the hand, more of it you can control the mouse with the palm by moving it in front of the camera.
